                <h1>The 9-Minute Strength Workout</h1>
                <p>
                    No matter your age or athletic ability, strength training is the key to flexibility, mobility,
                    improved performance and lower injury risk. Anyone, at any fitness level, can and should strength
                    train. And it doesn't have to take hours at the gym to see results. We’ll teach you the basics of
                    strength training in the comfort of your own home. It’ll take only nine minutes of exertion to
                    complete a full-body strength-building workout. Grab a towel and get ready to feel strong.
                </p>

                <h2>Set 1: Bodyweight Squat, Push-Ups and Mountain Climbers</h2>
                Do each of the exercises in this set for one minute each, not stopping between exercises.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row featurette d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center">

                    </h2>
                    <p class="lead">You squat every time you sit or stand, but don’t take this exercise for granted. It
                        works your legs and your glutes, the most powerful muscle group in the body.

                        Be careful: Done incorrectly, squats can be hard on your knees. As you squat, keep your butt
                        pushed out, like you are about to sit on a chair. Use the muscles in your hips and thighs to
                        push yourself up; don’t press your knees forward as you move. If you’re doing it correctly, your
                        knees will move only during the first half of the squat; your hips will finish the movement.

                        Challenge yourself: You can add some plyometric motion to a squat by jumping from the lowest
                        position back into your starting stance.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <p class="lead">There’s a reason push-ups are a go-to exercise for body builders. They effectively
                        work the muscles in your shoulders and chest.

                        Modify it: If standard push-ups are too challenging, try them with your knees on the floor. That
                        will reduce the amount of weight you need to lift.

                        Challenge yourself: If basic push-ups are too easy, place your feet on a step or block to
                        increase the intensity.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <p class="lead">This exercise mimics the motion climbers make as they climb steep peaks, except it’s
                        done on the soft, flat surface of your floor. Mountain climbers are total body workouts,
                        building strength in your core, back, arms and legs — not to mention your heart.

                        Modify it: If this exercise puts too much strain on your wrists, try elevating your upper body
                        by placing your hands on a step to reduce the weight being placed on your arms.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <p class="lead">A commonly seen exercise, plank helps build strength in the core, shoulders,
                        arms and legs. Plank tones your abs and builds strength in your upper body. Additionally,
                        planks strengthen both the abdominal and low back muscles simultaneously and can have a
                        beneficial effect for people with low back pain.

                        Be careful: Plank pose can be hard on your wrists, which is why we suggest doing a plank on
                        your forearm.

                        Modify it: Place your knees on the floor as you do plank to reduce the weight resting on
                        your forearms.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <p class="lead">This variation on a squat really targets (the quadricep and hamstring muscles in
                        your legs as well as the glutes. Jumping into your starting position from the lowest point in
                        your squat also adds a plyometric boost.

                        Be careful: If balance is an issue, you can do this exercise close to a wall, resting your hand
                        on it for support.

                        Modify it: Omit the plyometric jump if you find this exercise too hard on your knees.

                        Challenge yourself: Jump higher to really get your heart pumping and build more strength.</p>

                        Challenge yourself: Place your stable foot on a step or bench as you do this exercise to allow

                    <p class="lead">Fun to say, but also great for your body, this total body exercise will get your
                        heart pumping fast, but don’t sacrifice form for speed. Keep your body in control as you move
                        through the exercise.

                        Be careful: If you do burpees too quickly, you will soon be gasping for breath. Try to pace
                        yourself and your breathing. Take an in breath before you squat and breathe out during the
                        push-up.

                        Modify it: Add leg modifications to make this more difficult. Leg modifications can include
                        putting the right leg into a 3 o’clock position and then bringing it back to center, then
                        bringing the left leg to a 9 o’clock position and then bringing it back to center, and then
                        doing a push-up. We call this the 3 o’clock 9 o’clock burpee.

                        Challenge yourself: To move faster through your burpees, start stretching your legs back before
                        your hands hit the ground. Also don’t arch your back as you move, to allow your legs full range

                    <p class="lead">This exercise is a great way to tone your lower body. It helps to improve balance,
                        while also targeting your hamstrings.

                        Be careful: If you have balance issues, do this exercise near a wall that you can hang onto for
                        support if you need to.

                        Challenge Yourself: To make this more difficult, put a little hop in your planted leg when you
                        stand up. This turns this exercise from isokinetic to plyometric and increases the degree of
                        difficulty.
