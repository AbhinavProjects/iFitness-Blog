                <p>
                    It is vital to have awareness of the most healthful foods to ensure a wide a range of nutrients in
                    the diet.

                    A balanced diet is the secret to healthful eating. This article will cover the 15 most healthful
                    foods and their benefits.
                </p>
                <p>
                <h2>Nuts, pulses, and grains</h2>
                Nuts, pulses, and grains are all highly nutritious. The following are some of the most healthful:

                        <h3>1. Almonds</h3>
                        <p>
                        <h6>Almonds provide plenty of nutrients, including:</h6>

                        <p>1: magnesium</p>
                        <p>2: vitamin E</p>
                        <p>3: iron</p>
                        <p>4: calcium</p>
                        <p>5: fiber</p>
                        <p>6: riboflavin</p>

                        <h6>One 2019 meta-analysis found that consuming almonds significantly reduced total cholesterol
                            levels.</h6>
                        </p>
                        <h3>2. Brazil nuts</h3>
                        <p>
                            Brazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa) are some of the most healthful nuts available.

                            They are an excellent source of both protein and carbohydrates, and they also provide good
                            amounts of vitamin B-1, vitamin E, magnesium, and zinc.

                            Brazil nuts also contain more selenium than many other foods. Selenium is a vital mineral
                            for maintaining thyroid function, and it is a great antioxidant for the human body.

                            These nuts come in a hard shell and are usually available ready to eat, making them a quick,
                            nutritious snack.
                        </p>
                        <h3>3. Oatmeal</h3>
                        <p>
                            Interest in oatmeal has increased considerably during the past 20 years because of its
                            health benefits.

                            In 1997, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) agreed that foods with high levels of rolled
                            oats or oat bran could include data on the label about their cardiovascular health benefits
                            as part of a low fat diet. This led to a surge in oatmeal’s popularity.

                            Research has found that the cereal’s soluble fiber content helps lower cholesterol levels
                            and reduce cardiovascular risk factors.

                            Oats contain complex carbohydrates, as well as water-soluble fiber. These slow down
                            digestion and help stabilize levels of blood glucose. Oatmeal is also a good source of
                            folate and potassium.

                            People can make oatmeal from rolled or ground oats. Coarse or steel-cut oats contain more
                            fiber than instant varieties.
                        </p>
                        <h3>4. Wheat germ</h3>
                        <p>
                        <h6>Wheat germ is high in several vital nutrients, including:</h6>

                        <p>1: fiber</p>
                        <p>2: vitamin E</p>
                        <p>3: folic acid</p>
                        <p>4: thiamin</p>
                        <p>5: zinc</p>
                        <p>6: magnesium</p>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        <h2>Fruits, vegetables, and berries</h2>
                        Fruits, vegetables, and berries are easy to incorporate into the diet. The following are some of
                        the most healthful:
                        </p>

                        <div class="carousel-item active">
                            <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/1400x400/?Fruits, vegetables, and berries"

                            <div class="carousel-caption d-none d-md-block">

                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <h3>1: Broccoli</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Broccoli provides good amounts of fiber, calcium, potassium, folate, and
                                    phytonutrients. Phytonutrients are compounds that reduce the risk of developing
                                    heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers.

                                    Broccoli also provides essential antioxidants such as vitamin C and beta-carotene.
                                    In fact, a single half-cup serving of broccoli can provide around 85% of a person’s
                                    daily vitamin C value.

                                    Another compound in broccoli, called sulforaphane, may have anticancer and
                                    anti-inflammatory qualities, according to one 2019 study.

                                    However, overcooking broccoli can destroy many of its key nutrients. For this
                                    reason, it is best to eat it raw or lightly steamed.
                                </p>
                                <h3>2: Apples</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Apples are an excellent source of antioxidants, which combat free radicals. Free
                                    radicals are damaging substances that the body generates. They cause undesirable
                                    changes in the body and may contribute to chronic conditions, as well as the aging
                                    process.

                                    However, some studies have suggested that an antioxidant in apples might extend a
                                    person’s life span and reduce the risk of chronic disease.
                                </p>
                                <h3>3: Kale</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Kale is a leafy green vegetable that offers a wide range of different nutrients. For
                                    example, this powerfully nutritious plant is an excellent source of vitamins C and
                                    K.

                                    People can cook or steam kale. They can also blend it into smoothies or juices for a
                                    nutritional kick.
                                </p>
                                <h3>4: Avocados</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Some people avoid consuming avocados due to their high fat content. However,
                                    avocados provide healthful fats, as well as B vitamins, vitamin K, and vitamin E.
                                    Avocados are also a good source of fiber.

                                    In one 2018 review of studies, avocados increased levels of high-density
                                    lipoprotein, or “good,” cholesterol. This type of cholesterol removes more harmful
                                    cholesterol from the bloodstream.

                                    Avocados might also have anticancer properties. A 2019 test tube study of avocados
                                    showed that colored avocado seed extract reduced the viability of breast, colon, and
                                    prostate cancer cells. However, the study did not indicate whether or not the
                                    effects would be the same in humans.

                                    Avocados may also have associations with improved nutrient absorption, better
                                    overall diet, and fewer metabolic risk factors, according to one 2013 study.
                                </p>

                            <h2>Fish, meat, and eggs</h2>
                            When it comes to fish, meat, and eggs, many healthful options are available. For example:
                            </p>

                                </div>
                                <div>
                                    <p>
                                    <h3>1: Oily fish
                                    </h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Some examples of oily fish include salmon, trout, mackerel, herring, sardines,
                                        and anchovies. These types of fish have oil in their tissues and around their
                                        gut.

                                        Their lean fillets contain high levels of omega-3 fatty acids. These oils may
                                        provide benefits for the heart and nervous system, according to the Office of
                                        Dietary Supplements (ODS).

                                        The ODS also suggest that omega-3 fatty acids can help with inflammatory
                                        conditions such as arthritis. They are also plentiful in vitamins A and D.

                                        One 2014 study suggested that fatty acids can significantly reduce the risk of
                                        rheumatoid arthritis.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>2: Chicken</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Chicken is a cost effective and healthful meat. Free-range chicken serves as an
                                        excellent source of protein.

                                        However, it is important to remember that preparation and cooking methods affect
                                        how healthful chicken is. This means that people should limit their intake of
                                        deep-fried chicken and always remove the skin before consumption. Chicken skin
                                        has high levels of saturated fat.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>3: Eggs
                                    </h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Eggs are another source of protein that people can easily incorporate into a
                                        balanced diet, as they are highly versatile.

                                        Eggs contain vitamins including B-2 and B-12, both of which are important for
                                        preserving energy and generating red blood cells. Eggs are also a good source of
                                        the essential amino acid leucine, which plays a role in stimulating muscle
                                        protein synthesis. Eggs also provide a good amount of choline, which is
                                        important for cell membranes.

                                        The yolk contains most of the egg’s vitamins and minerals, as well as the fat
                                        and cholesterol. However, one 2017 review found that eating up to seven eggs per
                                        week does not increase the risk of heart disease. That said, the authors mention
                                        that people with cardiovascular disease or diabetes should seek medical
